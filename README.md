# Unity Dialogue Manager
By Orchid Winters

This is a piece of code that I've spent the last month or so coding on or off, just to learn how to make a custom editor in Unity.
Saving and loading DOES NOT WORK, nor is there a way to call it from your existing game. This is for other people to build off of.
I stopped working on this because (a) I'm really excited to start working on other projects, and (b) Unity's constant bugs and Unity
not being open source has made me decide to never work with Unity again.

# Use
Download all of the files and put them into an folder called "Editor". A menu option called "Custom Tools" should appear. Hooray.

Enjoy!

P.S. I know that there are no comments I didn't think that I would put this on GitHub.
